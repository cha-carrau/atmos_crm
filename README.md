# Tempo - Outreach CRM

A client-only CRM application built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS to help you track outreach, manage contacts, and never miss a follow-up.

## Run this and send your data

Use this if you are setting up your own copy, connecting your Outlook, and sending the data file back to Charlotte.

### Open the app

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is required. In a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cha-carrau/tempo.git
cd tempo
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. Leave that terminal running while you use the app.

### Log in

The first screen is **AtmosOne CRM**. Type your name and email, then click **Create workspace**. That is the sign-in. There is no password.

This creates your own workspace on your computer. It does not include Charlotte's contacts.

### Sync Outlook

Create your own Azure app registration, then connect this copy of the app to it.

1. In the project folder, copy `.env.example` to a new file named `.env.local`.
2. In `.env.local`, set `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `AZURE_TENANT_ID` from that Azure app registration.
3. On the registration, add a **Web** redirect URI of exactly `http://localhost:3000/api/outlook/callback`.
4. Under Microsoft Graph, add these delegated permissions: `Mail.Read`, `Calendars.Read`, `Contacts.Read`, `offline_access`, and `User.Read`.
5. Save `.env.local`, then restart the dev server (`npm run dev`) so it picks up the new values.

In the app, open **Outlook** in the top navigation. Click **Connect Outlook** and sign in with Microsoft. When it is connected, click **Sync now**.

### Send your data back

Open **Settings** with the gear icon at the top right. In the section **Share a copy of your data**, click **Download all data**.

The file is named `atmosone-data-YYYY-MM-DD.json`. It is JSON, not a CSV. It includes contacts, companies, lists, and events. Send that file to Charlotte.

Charlotte opens **Settings**, clicks **Upload data to update**, reviews the summary of what will be added and updated, and clicks **Confirm update**.

A mailing list also has a **Download CSV** button. That file contains only the email addresses on that list. The file to send for a full update is the JSON from **Download all data**.

## Key Features Explained

### Follow-up Dashboard

The home page shows three prioritized sections:

1. **Overdue** (Red/Orange/Yellow): Follow-ups that are past due
   - Critical: 7+ days overdue (Red)
   - High: 3-7 days overdue (Orange)
   - Medium: 1-3 days overdue (Yellow)

2. **Due Today** (Blue): Follow-ups that need attention today

3. **On Track** (Green): Contacts with upcoming follow-ups still in the safe zone

### Contact Status Management

Each person can have one of three statuses:

- **Active**: Show on follow-up dashboard (default)
- **Parked**: Temporarily hidden from dashboard
- **Closed**: Removed from active tracking

Click the status badge on a person's detail page to cycle through statuses.

### Custom Event Types

In the Settings page, you can:

- Create custom event types (e.g., "WhatsApp Message", "Slack DM")
- Choose category: Outbound Message, Inbound Message, or Meeting
- Set default follow-up thresholds (1-365 days)
- Edit follow-up days for default event types
- Delete custom event types (with conflict resolution)

### Custom Follow-up Overrides

When logging an event, you can:

- Use the default follow-up threshold for that event type
- Override with a custom number of days for this specific event
- Edit the follow-up days later if plans change

### Quick Actions on Follow-ups

Each follow-up card on the home page includes action buttons:

- **They Replied**: Quick-log an inbound response (only for outbound messages)
- **Add Event**: Log any new interaction
- **Park**: Temporarily remove from dashboard
- **Close**: Mark contact as closed

### Search & Filter

The home page search bar filters across:
- Person names
- Company names
- Email addresses
- Job titles
- Event types
- Notes (both person and event notes)

### Company Management

- Autocomplete search when adding/editing people
- Inline company creation during person creation
- Automatic linking of people to companies
- Company detail pages show all associated contacts

### CSV Import/Export

Access from the Settings page:

**Export**:
- Downloads a single CSV file with all data
- Includes people, companies, events, and custom event types
- One event per row (person/company info repeats)
- Filename includes current date

**Import**:
- Upload a previously exported CSV file
- Recreates all data including custom event types
- Replaces existing data (backup first!)
- Handles data migration automatically

## Usage Tips

1. **Start by adding companies** - Makes contact organization easier
2. **Create people and link to companies** - Use autocomplete for quick linking
3. **Log events with proper timing** - Include time for same-day events
4. **Check the home page daily** - Stay on top of overdue and due-today items
5. **Use quick actions** - "They Replied" button speeds up common workflows
6. **Customize event types** - Add types that match your outreach channels
7. **Park inactive contacts** - Keep your dashboard focused on active outreach
8. **Export regularly** - Back up your data or move between devices
9. **Search when needed** - Quickly find specific contacts or event types
10. **Adjust follow-up thresholds** - Fine-tune timing in Settings
